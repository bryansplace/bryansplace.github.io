## Install PMbootstrap

You will need a linux based system. 

The official installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installing_pmbootstrap)

Unfortunately, there are are altrrnatives, which as a beginner, confused me more than it should.

I personally found [using pip] (https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Pmbootstrap/Installation#Using_pip) simplest.


Whatever, in the end...To test that pmbootstrap is installed correctly, run:

    pmbootstrap --version
