Hello!
This is where I keep stuff that I want to remember in case I need to do things again.

Main subject is [reuse an old smartphone](/Reuse_an_Old_Smart_Phone.md) which shows how to install Alpine linux on an old phone and turn it into a docker based home lab which can, among most other things, run home assistant.

I hope you find this useful.
