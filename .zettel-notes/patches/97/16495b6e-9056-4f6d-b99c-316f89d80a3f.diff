+The install will have created two files that need to be flashed to the phone; lk2nd ( a qualcom specific secondary bootloader) and rootfs
+( the root file system)
+
+The Xiaomi A1 tissot phone actually has what they call an A/B structure.  I won't explain [it](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Android_AB_Slots) here, but I want to be sure it always boots into the new system, so I choose to flash it to both A and B slots
+
+Ensure device is still in fastboot mode, and plugged in via USB. Then, on the PC, run:
+```
+    $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_lk2nd --partition boot_a
+    $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_lk2nd --partition boot_b
+    $ pmbootstrap flasher flash_rootfs --partition userdata
+    $ fastboot reboot 
+```
+The system should reboot. As the display option was none, there is little indication that things have succeded
+
+Wait a while (a couple of minutes) as the phone reboots with PostmarketOS.
