-### 6.3) docker-compose
-
-The docker-compose.yml file groups all the docker commands needed to load the systems we want; currently HomeAssistant and MQTT.
-
-Where you put this file isn't critical; to keep things simple I suggest you create it in the home directory (~).
-
-Note: To create a text file, the Linux command line editors (eg nano) are ...what can I say..... geeky . You can use Nano that was installed during the earlier setup or install another editor. I personally use 'CX file explorer' on my normal android phone and connect via SFTP.
-
-Whatever, create the file 'docker-compose.yml' and insert the following for homeassistant and mqtt services
-
-    version: '3'
-    services:
-      homeassistant:
-        container_name: homeassistant
-        image: "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:2022.7.1"
-        volumes:
-          - /home/bryan/volumes/hass:/config
-          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
-          - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro
-          - /sys:/sys
-        network_mode: host
-        restart: unless-stopped
-        depends_on:
-          - mqtt
-
-      mqtt:
-        container_name: mqtt    
-        image: "eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.13"
-        volumes:
-          - /home/bryan/volumes/mosquitto/config:/mosquitto/config
-          - /home/bryan/volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log
-          - /home/bryan/volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data
-          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
-        network_mode: host
-        restart: unless-stopped
-Obviously, change 'bryan' to your user name.
-
-The versions (eg :1.6.13) are optional, but I like to 'freeze' the versions to avoid surprises
-
-This contains the instructions to pull ( download) the standard docker 'image' to build your working 'container'. The volumes tell it where to store data and the network mode 'host' tells it not to isolate containers in a separate network as Docker would normally do.
-
-### 6.4) Docker-compose up
-
-When run for the first time, the following instruction will cause docker to pull (download) and extract the files. This is time consuming and needs the battery charged.
-
-    sudo docker-compose pull
-
-When everything finishes downloading, run
-
-    sudo docker-compose  up -d 
-
-This will start Home Assistant; the -d flag is detached mode which gives you back control of the console.
-
-Wait a few minutes as things take a little time to set up the first time.
-
-To access Home Assistant, from any machine on your local network, use an internet browser to connect to 192.168.X.XXX/8123.
-
-You should have access to the normal home assistant log-in screen.
