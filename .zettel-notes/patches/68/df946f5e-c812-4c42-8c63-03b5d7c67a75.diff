+I want just a basic alpine server with the minimum of stuff installed. So we use the route using [Pmbootstrap init](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation/Using_pmbootstrap#Initializing_pmbootstrap)   to tell pmbootstrap what device we have and what options we want.
+
+On your PC, run 
+```$pmbootstrap init```
+ 
+
+This will give a series of options.
+Accept the defaults... 
+Except:
+- Channel: Edge
+- Vendor:  qcom 
+- Device codename: msm8953
+- User Interface: none 
+ (As I just want a server, I don't want any user interface. Connection is through SSH.)
+- Additional packages : nano,networkmanager,networkmanager-wifi,networkmanager-cli,networkmanager-tui,wpa_supplicant
+(Surprisingly, the qcom package doesn't have standard network manager. So its best to add them in here.)
+
+You'll be asked for a username . This will later be needed for login to the phone device (  thru SSH)
