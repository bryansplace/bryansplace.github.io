+## Repurposing the Past, Powering the Future
+
+Welcome to my corner of the web. I like to breath new life into "obsolete" hardware—specifically turning old smartphones into functional, low-power homelabs.
+
+### What I Do
+Most smartphones are retired long before their hardware is actually useless. By utilizing **PostmarketOS** (based on **Alpine Linux**), old abandoned Android devices can be used as  stable, lightweight servers.
