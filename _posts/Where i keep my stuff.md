### Introduction

I keep my 'notes' in too many places....

Google Keep is useful for quick and draft notes. But ther is no way to sort them by date.

Zettel notes seems a good Markdown note editor for Android. It can synchronize with Github.

Obsidian seems very powerful, but overpowerful and complicated for me.

Wordpress seems well supported, can provide a self hosted site, but again overcomplicated.

### What do I want
