This site is, obviously, hosted on github. 

I wanted a simple static site and looked at all sorts of alternatives. My main concern was to find something simple and easy. This summarizes where I'm at.

Setting up the site can be done by following the [Github Skills course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
