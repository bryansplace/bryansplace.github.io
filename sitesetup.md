## Initial setup

This site is, obviously, hosted on github. 

I wanted a simple static site and looked at all sorts of alternatives. My main concern was to find something simple and easy. This summarizes where I'm at.

Setting up the site can be done by following the [Github Skills course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).

As Github uses the Jekyll system for it's site, I thought it necessary to understand Jekyll. Error, Jekyll is undoutably very flexible but accordingly very complex..too complex. Once set up, new pages can just be added in. 

## Themes

Github supports different themes which can change the way the site looks. An initial look indicated that I'll stick with the default 'minima' and maybe change later.

## Config

The [config.yml file](https://github.com/bryansplace/bryansplace.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml)   controls Jekyll.
