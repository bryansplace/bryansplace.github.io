I'm an elderly geek who really doesn't like throwing things away. I get a lot of satisfaction from keeping old stuff running — whether that's an Alpine phone running my homelab and Home Assistant, or just giving new life to hardware most people would have binned years ago.

I tend to dabble in a lot of areas: genealogy, physics, bowling, messing with home automation, and finding ways to make tech work my way (usually with as little waste and as much tinkering as possible). I enjoy solving problems, even if it takes going down a few rabbit holes to get there.

This blog is mostly a mix of things I’m experimenting with, fixing, or trying to understand better — often techy, sometimes personal, and occasionally just plain odd. 

If something here helps you out or gives you an idea, even better.
